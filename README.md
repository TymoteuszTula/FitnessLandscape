## Setting up your environment

It is advised to set up a conda environment to ensure compatibility before using this software. The file ```corrconn_env.yml``` has been provided for this purpose. 

### Instructions

To find out which environments are currently available in your system (the asterisk indicates which one is active):

conda info --envs

If corrconn appears on the list, activate it using 

```conda activate corrconn```

You can later go back to your default enviornment using 

```conda deactivate```

If corrconn does not appear on the list, you must install it first:

```conda env create --file corrconn_env.yml```

## Getting started

Check out the tutorial in the docs folder (a Jupyter notebook).
